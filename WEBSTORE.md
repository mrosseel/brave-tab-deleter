## Detailed Description

Tab Deleter - A powerful sidebar for managing your browser tabs

FEATURES:

- Sidebar Panel - Click the extension icon to open a clean sidebar showing all your tabs organized by groups

- Auto-Grouping - Automatically groups tabs by domain when 2+ tabs share the same site (e.g., all YouTube tabs grouped together)

- Custom Groups - Create your own groups with custom names, colors, and domain patterns. Tabs matching your patterns are automatically sorted into the right group

- Drag & Drop - Reorder tabs and groups by dragging. Move tabs between groups or to "Other" (ungrouped)

- Sleep Groups - Put tab groups to sleep to save memory. Sleeping groups save URLs and can be restored later

- All Windows Mode - Optionally show and manage tabs from all browser windows in one sidebar

- Audio Indicator - See which tabs are playing audio with a speaker icon on the favicon

Works with Chrome and Brave browsers.
